=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object oriented interface to the NZBMatrix APIs
   
=head1 METHODS

=head2 new
    
    $api = API::NZBMatrix->new( 
        { 
            'username' => 'nzbmatrix_user',
            'apikey'   => 'nzbmatrix_apikey',
            'ssl'      => 1, #OPTIONAL
        }
    );

Accepts one argument which must be a hash reference containing the 
keys 'username' being the username for your NZBmarix login for your
account, and 'apikey' being the api key corresponding to that account.
The hash ref can also contain the key 'ssl' with any true value to
enable the use of ssl/https when communicating with the APIs.

Returns an object setup with your NZBMatric authentication details.
    
=head2 account

The account method takes no arguments and uses the username and 
apikey supplied during construction to retrieve some details of the
account.  Returns a hash reference or list depending on the calling
context:

    $account_details = $api->account();
    %account_details = $api->account();

The returned hash looks like:

    {
          'API_DAILY_DOWNLOAD' => '0', #Downloads via API for the day 
          'USERID' => '606735',        #Account ID
          'API_DAILY_RATE' => '28',    #API calls for the hour
          'USERNAME' => 'username'     #Username on the site.
    }

=head2 bookmark

The bookmark method allows you to add or remove bookmarks.  It 
accepts either a single scalar value which will be the ID of an NZB
or a hash ref containing the options applicable to this API function.
In the case of a hash ref, the nzb_id is mandatory, the rest is
optional.

    $success = $api->bookmark('12345');
    
    $success = $api->bookmark(
        {
            nzb_id => '12345',
            action => ('add'|'remove'), #defaults to 'add'
        }
    );

Returns true (1) if successful, undef if there is an error.

=head2 details

The details method retrieves the details of a specifc NZB given its
ID.  Accepts a single scalar argument being the ID of the NZB to be
queried.

Returns a hash reference or list depending on the calling
context:

    $details = $api->details('12345');
    %details = $api->details('12345');

Return hash is in the form:

    {
        'NZBID'       => '444027', # NZB ID On Site
        'NZBNAME'     => 'mandriva linux 2009', # NZB Name On Site
        'LINK'        => 'nzbmatrix.com/nzb-details.php?id=444027&hit=1', # Link To NZB Details Page
        'SIZE'        => '1469988208.64', # Size in bytes
        'INDEX_DATE'  => '2009-02-14 09:08:55', # Indexed By Site (Date/Time GMT)
        'USENET_DATE' => '2009-02-12 2:48:47', # Posted To Usenet (Date/Time GMT)
        'CATEGORY'    => 'TV: SD', # NZB Post Category
        'GROUP'       => 'alt.binaries.linux', # Usenet Newsgroup
        'COMMENTS'    => '0', # Number Of Comments Posted
        'HITS'        => '174', # Number Of Hits (Views)
        'NFO'         => 'yes', # NFO Present
        'WEBLINK'     => 'http://linux.org', # HTTP Link To Attached Website
        'LANGUAGE'    => 'English', # Language Attached From Our Index
        'IMAGE'       => 'http://linux.org/logo.gif', # HTTP Link To Attached Image
        'REGION'      => '0', # Region Coding (See notes)
    }

=head2 download

The details method retrieves the NZB given its ID.
Accepts a single scalar argument being the ID of the NZB to be
downloaded or a hash ref containing the keys 'nzb_id' being the ID
of the NZB to download and an optional 'file' key containing a file
name to write the NZB contents to.  In either case, if no 'file' is
supplied the NZB contents are returned as a scalar string.

If 'file' is supplied, the return values is 1/true.

    $nzb = $api->download('12345');
    
    $success = $api->download(
        {
            'nzb_id' => '12345',
            'file'   => '/path/to/file.nzb',
        }
    );

Note that if the file already exists, an error will be set and undef
returned.
If 'file' contains a directory path (full or relative) and the 
directory doesn't exist, we won't create it here. An error will be 
set and undef returned.

=head2 search
 
The search method accepts either a single scalar that will be used 
as the search term and all other options will be the default as set
by the API or a single hash ref allowing the full compliment of 
options to be set in which case 'search_term' is mandatory, the rest
are optional.

    $search_results = $api->search('A search term');
    
    $search_results = $api->search( 
        {   
            'search_term'  => 'A search term',
            'category'     => 'NZBMatrix search category'
            'max_results'  => 10, # number
            'max_age'      => 10, # number of days
            'region'       => ('PAL'|'NTSC'|'FREE'),
            'news_group'   => 'Name of news group', #NOT VALIDATED
            'min_size'     => 10, # number of MB
            'max_size'     => 10, # number of MB
            'min_hits'     => 10, # number of hits
            'max_hits'     => 10, # number of hits
            'english_only' => (1|0),
            'search_field' => ('name'|'subject'|'weblink'),
        }
    );

Returns a list of hash references each hash containing the details
of each result.  Example:

    {
        'NZBID'       => '444027', # NZB ID On Site
        'NZBNAME'     => 'mandriva linux 2009', # NZB Name On Site

Valid regions are:

=head2 site_status

The site_status method downloads the site status page at 
http://nzbmatrix.info/ and attempts to find the status of the
various components for which they provide statuses.

The page also may have a notice of some kind that provides important
information outside of the normal components being online/offline.

The method needs no arguments and returns a scalar containing a
reference to a hash or a list depending on the calling context.

    $status = $api->site_status();
    %status = $api->site_status();

The return hash looks like:

    {
        'NZBxxx RSS'       => 'Online',
        'NZBMatrix API'    => 'Online',
        'Payment Gateways' => 'Online',
        'NZBMatrix'        => 'Online',
        'Notice'           => 'Issues on RSS and bookmark is Offline ATM',
        'NZBxxx API'       => 'Online',
        'NZBxxx'           => 'Online',
        'NZBMatrix RSS'    => 'Online'
    }
    
=head2 error

The error method can be used to retrive the last error that occured.
All methods that fail, will set an error retrivable by this method, 
and then return undef.

Therefore it is good practice to check for a positive result for
each method call and then call error() if the result is 'false'.

Eg:

    $success = $api->bookmark('12345');
    unless ($success) {
        $error = $api->error();
        print $error if $error;
    }

Retrieving the error will clear the error meaning that a subsequent
call will return undef.
